If you took part in the [Kaggle survey][kaggle-survey] about data science,
you might be stumpled upon the [Data Skeptic Podcast][dsp].
It's one of my favourite data science podcast.

They did a great episode about the louvain distance for [community detection][source].
Basically it's a mathematical way of weighing the interconnectedness of a connected graph.

So the cool thing about this podcast episode, there is a beautiful implementation by another Blogger named  [Eliot Andres][jupyter]. He created an amazing [Tutorial/Jupyter Notebook][jupyter] to calculate the louvain distance for facebook friends.
