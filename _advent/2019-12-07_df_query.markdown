Little did I know. Reading Wes McKinneys introduction to Data Science.
I started writing filters like this over and over:
df[(df.height < 200) & (df.weight < 100)]

A few years passed and I read the new edition about Python for finance.
Bam! I couldn't believe how easy and practical the query method is.

{% highlight python %}
df[(df.height < 200) & (df.weight < 100)]
#vs
df.query('height < 200 and weight < 100')
{% endhighlight %}
